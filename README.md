# colour_detection
This project is an AI-based color detection tool built using OpenCV and Pandas libraries. It allows users to upload an image, and by double-clicking on any area of the image, the tool detects and displays the exact color name and its corresponding RGB values. This is useful for identifying colors in real-time from pictures.
